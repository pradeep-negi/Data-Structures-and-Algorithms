# Overview
This repository is a collection of a variety of algorithms implemented in C++. These algorithms span a variety of topics and are helpful for the preparation of coding interviews and competitive programming.

# Features
- The repository provides implementations of various algorithms in C++.
- Well documented source code.
- Each source code is atomic using STL classes and no external libraries are required for their compilation and execution. Thus, the fundamentals of the algorithms can be studied in much depth.
- Source codes are compiled and tested for corner testcases.
- Strict adherence to C++11 standard ensures portability of code.

# Contributions
All programmers are invited for new un-plagiarized quality contributions.
